* Average (But reproducable) dotfiles.
Right now they are somewhat basic. I would suggest using someone elses dotfiles
for reference.
* Setup
Flakes, NixOS, Home-Manager.
Main purpose is to be a development system, that is capable of gaming as well.
I mainly use Emacs where possible, and write mostly Rust, however I play around
with a lot of other languages.
